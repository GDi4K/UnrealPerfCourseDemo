We will use this example Unreal Engine app as the demo for the [Unreal Perf Course](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLsyGu3bA_w_AtJl6HiJfXcazzxuQN-udi). We will use different branches for different lessons & we will link to the correct branch in lesson.

## What's Inside

This is what you can see inside this project:

* A landscape created with Unreal Engine Landmass plugin
* Ocean with 4.26 Water System
* Using [OpenLand](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/openland-customizable-landscape-auto-material?sessionInvalidated=true) as the landscape material
* Using [OpenLand Grass](https://unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/openland-grass-customizable-game-ready-grass-system) for grass
* A MegaScan Rock

## License

It's complicated. So, this project will be unlicensed. It'll be just for you to try out. This is not a redistribution in anyway. Here's more on that.

* OpenLand & OpenLand Grass [can be distributed](https://github.com/GameDev4K/unreal-openland) for non-commercial purpose. (So, we are good here)
* We use a MegaScan Rock & we cannot distribute it.
